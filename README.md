# KillingGround
A primitive 2d turn based strategy game implemented in nim and the library nico
# Why 2d
It's easier. Also i like retro grapics. There is a charm.
# Why potato graphics
Games with fancy graphics arent good games.
Its good that people push immersion, but I'd rather play something nice
